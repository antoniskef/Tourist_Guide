# Tourist_Guide
Consists of 3 projects:

-> initialise_tables: creates the tables and inserts data into them, 

-> tourist_guide_app: the app for the tourist, in which he searches by filtering and adds favourites,

-> tourist_guide_app_admin: the app for the admin, in which he inserts data into the database and deletes from it. 

## Libraries 
 -> pandas (pip install pandas),
 
 -> sqlite3,
 
 -> tkinter.
 
 ## Relational model 
 Like FAV_FOOD_AND_DRINK is linked to FOOD_AND_DRINK, all tables should be linked like that, but they are not in order for the model to be more noticable.
